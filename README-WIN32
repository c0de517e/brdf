How to compile BRDF Explorer for Windows
========================================

The following external dependencies are required (versions are ones that I used, other might also work):
	- Qt 4.8.1
	- GLEW 1.9.0
	- ZLib 1.2.5
	- GLUT 3.7

Make sure that qmake is in your PATH. Also put GLEW, ZLib and GLUT include and library directories somewhere VC can find them.

Use Visual Studio 2010 command prompt. Navigate to "brdf/src/brdf" directory and run "qmake -tp vc", this will generate the vcxproj file.
Navigate to "brdf" directory and run "qmake -tp vc", this will generate sln file which should just build (as long as external dependencies are satisfied).
